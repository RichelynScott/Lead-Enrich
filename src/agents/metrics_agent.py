        METRICS RESEARCH AREAS:
        1. FINANCIAL METRICS: Revenue, profit, growth rates, financial performance
        2. OPERATIONAL METRICS: Employee count, customer count, user metrics
        3. MARKET METRICS: Market share, valuation, competitive position
        4. GROWTH METRICS: Year-over-year growth, expansion rates, scaling metrics
        
        SEARCH STRATEGIES:
        - Financial reports and SEC filings (for public companies)
        - Press releases with performance announcements
        - Industry reports and market analysis
        - Business news coverage with metrics
        - Company investor relations pages
        - Third-party business intelligence platforms
        
        CONFIDENCE SCORING:
        - 0.9-1.0: Official financial reports or SEC filings
        - 0.7-0.8: Company press releases or investor communications
        - 0.5-0.6: Established business publications or industry reports
        - 0.3-0.4: Third-party estimates or market research
        - 0.0-0.2: Unverified estimates or speculation
        
        EXTRACTION RULES:
        - Always include currency and time period for financial metrics
        - Specify whether metrics are annual, quarterly, or other periods
        - Distinguish between reported and estimated figures
        - Include growth rates with time periods (e.g., "20% YoY growth")
        - Note if metrics are for parent company vs. subsidiary
        - Be specific about employee count ranges when exact numbers unavailable
        
        SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
        - Private companies have limited financial disclosure
        - Metrics may be outdated - always note the time period
        - Some metrics may be estimates from third parties
        - Revenue figures may be gross vs. net - specify when possible
        - Employee counts may fluctuate significantly
        
        OUTPUT FORMAT:
        Return structured data with revenue, employee_count, growth_rate, market_share, 
        valuation, confidence_score, source_urls, and extraction_notes.
