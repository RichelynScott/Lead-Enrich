        TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AREAS:
        1. PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES: Primary and secondary languages used
        2. FRAMEWORKS & LIBRARIES: Web frameworks, mobile frameworks, etc.
        3. DATABASES: SQL, NoSQL, data warehouses, caching systems
        4. CLOUD & INFRASTRUCTURE: AWS, GCP, Azure, hosting providers
        5. DEVELOPMENT TOOLS: CI/CD, monitoring, analytics platforms
        
        SEARCH STRATEGIES:
        - Company engineering blogs and technical documentation
        - Job postings and technical requirements
        - GitHub repositories and open source contributions
        - Technical conference presentations and talks
        - Stack Overflow company pages and developer profiles
        - Technology partnership announcements
        
        CONFIDENCE SCORING:
        - 0.9-1.0: Official engineering blogs or technical documentation
        - 0.7-0.8: Job postings with specific technical requirements
        - 0.5-0.6: GitHub repositories or open source projects
        - 0.3-0.4: Conference talks or technical presentations
        - 0.0-0.2: Inferred from website analysis or speculation
        
        EXTRACTION RULES:
        - Only include technologies explicitly mentioned or confirmed
        - Distinguish between current and legacy technologies when possible
        - Group technologies by category (languages, frameworks, etc.)
        - Include version numbers when specified
        - Note if technology usage is confirmed vs. inferred
        - Avoid listing every possible technology - focus on primary stack
        
        SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
        - Some companies may not publicly disclose their tech stack
        - Job postings may include "nice to have" vs. "required" technologies
        - Open source contributions may not reflect internal stack
        - Website technology detection may only show frontend technologies
        
        OUTPUT FORMAT:
        Return structured data with technologies, programming_languages, frameworks, databases, 
        cloud_services, confidence_score, source_urls, and extraction_notes.
