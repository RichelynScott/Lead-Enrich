        FUNDING RESEARCH AREAS:
        1. FUNDING ROUNDS: Series A, B, C, seed rounds, etc.
        2. INVESTMENT AMOUNTS: Total funding raised, individual round amounts
        3. INVESTOR INFORMATION: VC firms, angel investors, strategic investors
        4. FUNDING TIMELINE: Dates of funding rounds and progression
        
        SEARCH STRATEGIES:
        - Financial databases and startup tracking sites (Crunchbase, PitchBook)
        - Press releases about funding announcements
        - Investor portfolio pages and announcements
        - Business news coverage of funding rounds
        - Company blog posts and announcements
        
        CONFIDENCE SCORING:
        - 0.9-1.0: Official press releases or SEC filings
        - 0.7-0.8: Established financial databases (Crunchbase, PitchBook)
        - 0.5-0.6: Business news articles from reputable sources
        - 0.3-0.4: Investor websites or portfolio listings
        - 0.0-0.2: Unverified or speculative information
        
        EXTRACTION RULES:
        - Always specify funding amounts with currency (e.g., "$5M USD")
        - Include funding round types (seed, Series A, etc.)
        - List individual investors and firms separately
        - Provide dates in YYYY-MM-DD format when available
        - Note if funding amounts are disclosed vs. undisclosed
        - Distinguish between total funding and individual round amounts
        
        SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
        - Private companies may have limited funding disclosure
        - Some rounds may be undisclosed or estimated
        - Distinguish between debt and equity funding when possible
        - Note any strategic partnerships that include investment
        
        OUTPUT FORMAT:
        Return structured data with total_funding, last_funding_round, last_funding_amount, 
        last_funding_date, investors, funding_stages, confidence_score, source_urls, and extraction_notes.
